	 Oscillator phase noise due to stochastic and uncorrelated circuit and supply noise can be analyzed as additive voltage disturbance $\delta v_n$ with variance $\sigma_{v_n}^2$ to the oscillator waveform $V_{osc}$ at any given time.  In a stable, noiseless oscillator, amplitude is inherently tied to signal phase, i.e. $V_{osc}(\Phi=\omega t)$. With additive noise, given $\frac{dV_{osc}(\Phi)}{d\Phi}$ is finite $\forall$t, a small voltage disturbance from noise $\delta v_{n}$ will be coupled as a disturbance $\delta\Phi_{n}$ in the oscillator phase, shown in figure \ref{fig:aperture_noise}. The phase evolution of the noisy oscillator for an infinitesimal time increment $\delta t$  with such a disturbance is:
	 \begin{equation}
		\Phi_{out}(t+\delta t) = \Phi_{out}(t) + \delta\Phi_n + \omega_{osc}\delta t \label{eq:rwalk_ph}
	 \end{equation}

	  Assuming $\delta v_n$ is Gaussian white noise, $\delta\Phi_{n}$ is sampled stochastically at any instant based on the probability distribution \ref{eq:osc_rw_dist}, dependent on the current oscillator phase $\Phi_{out}$ and the noiseless voltage-phase relation $V_{osc}(\Phi)$. It will be assumed that like the source noise $\delta v_n$, $\delta\Phi_{n}$ is white spectrum.
	 \begin{equation}
	 	P(\delta\Phi_{n}|\Phi_{out}) = \text{Norm}\left(\mu=0, \sigma=\sigma_{v_n}\left(\left.\frac{dV_{osc}(\Phi)}{d\Phi}\right\vert_{\Phi=\Phi_{out}}\right)^{-1}\right) \label{eq:osc_rw_dist}
	 \end{equation} 
	Spectral analysis of the noisy oscillator phase can be made utilizing discrete time-modeling. Converting \ref{eq:rwalk_ph} into a sampled signal with time step $\delta t$ 
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi_{out}[n+1] = \Phi_{out}[n] + \omega_{osc}\delta t + \delta\Phi_n[n|\Phi_{out}[n]]
	\end{equation}
	Computing the z-transform, and splitting the result into the oscillation $\Phi_{osc}$ and phase noise $\Phi_{n}$ components:
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi_{out}(z) = \frac{\omega_{osc}\delta t}{z-1} + \frac{\delta\Phi_n(z)}{z-1} = \Phi_{osc}(z) + \Phi_{n}(z)
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\Rightarrow \Phi_{n}(z) = \frac{\delta\Phi_n(z)}{z-1} \label{eq:z_osc_pn}
	\end{equation}
	Application of the bilinear transform to \ref{eq:z_osc_pn} can be used to approximate the continuous phase noise spectrum, if $s=j\omega$
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi_{n}(s) = \left.\Phi_{n}(z)\right\vert_{z=1-s\delta t} = \left.\frac{\delta\Phi_n(z)}{z-1}\right\vert_{z=1+s\delta t} = \frac{\delta\Phi_n(s)}{s\delta t}
	\end{equation}
	The phase noise PSD is therefore:
	\begin{equation}
		S_{\Phi n_{DCO}}(f)= \lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\Delta T}\left|\frac{\delta\Phi_n(j2\pi f)}{j2\pi f \delta t}*\mathcal{F}\left\{\text{rect}\left(\frac{t}{\Delta t}\right)\right\}\right|^2  =  \frac{S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}}{f^2}
	\end{equation}
	Following that the phase disturbance signal $\delta\Phi_{n}(t)$ is white spectrum, a constant value for its PSD $S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}$ can be defined. The value for $S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}$ is highly dependent on implementation and is best extracted by means of curve fitting simulation or physical measurement.
