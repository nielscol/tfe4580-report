\subsection{ADPLL - All Digital, Discrete Time PLL Model}\label{adpll_model}
Based on the continuous PLL theory, a model for a discrete time sampled all digital PLL (ADPLL) can be adapted. The general approach here utilizes the bilinear transformation \cite{proakis_1993_bilinear} to bridge between continuous s-domain models to discrete z-domain models. To ensure translation from s-to-z domains with negligible granularity effects due to time-sampling, a constraint for PLL loop sampling frequency commonly cited in PLL literature from \cite{gardner_1980} is imposed here. This is to constrain the loop sampling frequency $f_s > 10\cdot\textnormal{BW}_{loop}$, where BW$_{loop}$ is the PLL closed loop bandwidth.

\FloatBarrier
A basic architecture for implementing an all digital PLL is shown in figure \ref{fig:basic_adpll}, based from \cite{hsu_straayer_perrott_2008}\cite{temporiti_2009}, which replaces the phase detector of continuous PLL in figure \ref{fig:basic_pll} with a time to digital converter (TDC). Furthermore, the loop filter $\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)$ is replaced with a discrete-time loop filter $\mathrm{H}_{LF}(z)$, and the VCO with a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). In this architecture, all components are fully or partially digital in implementation. 

\subsubsection{Divider}\label{div_theory}
	A digital phase divider (also called frequency divider) is commonly implemented with a modulo-N counter which counts oscillator cycles \cite{weste_harris_2011}. With a divider ratio N, the output of the divider will have an active edge transition (considered to be rising edge as shown in figure \ref{fig:digital_div}) every N input cycles. Phase information is inferred from the output edge timing, which occurs with time interval N$/f_{osc}$, and is equal to the point at which output phase equals a multiple of $2\pi$. Thus a digital divider does not provider continuous phase information, but rather a sampled phase signal with rate $f_{osc}/$N. 
	\begin{figure}[htb!]
		\center\include{./figs/digital_div}
		\caption{Digital divider signals.}
		\label{fig:digital_div}
	\end{figure}

	For PLL transfer function modeling, a digital divider behaves identically to the continuous case:
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi_{div}[n] = \frac{\Phi_{out}[n]}{\mathrm{N}}
	\end{equation}
	In the z- and s-domain the divider transfer model is:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathrm{H}_{div}(z) = \mathrm{H}_{div}(s) = \frac{\Phi_{div}(z)}{\Phi_{out}(z)} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{N}}
	\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Time to Digital Converter}
	A time to digital converter (TDC) measures the the difference $\Delta t$ in arrival of two input signal \cite{machado_cabral_alves_2019}, which in the ADPLL synthesizer is the differential between the divider signal $\Phi_{div}$[n] and the reference frequency signal $\Phi_{ref}$[n]. With a known reference frequency $f_{ref}$, the measured time differential $\Delta t$ corresponds to a phase difference $\Delta\Phi=2\pi f_{ref}\Delta t$, thus the TDC acts as a phase detector. Being digitized, a TDC will have limited resolution in time (phase), defined here to be M steps per reference cycle. Figure \ref{fig:tdc} shows the basic TDC phase detector model architecture. This has a minimum step size in time of $\Delta t_{step}$ = $1/Mf_{ref}$. To map the output to digitized value, the model applies a scale factor M$/2\pi$ and floor rounding, so one least significant bit (LSB) of the output $e_\Phi[n]$ equates to $\Delta t_{step}$ timing error between inputs $\Phi_{div}$[n] and $\Phi_{ref}$[n]. The described TDC model in sampled-time equation form is in equation \ref{eq:tdc_disc_time_model}.

	% It takes input phase signals $\Phi_{div}$[n] and $\Phi_{ref}$[n], and outputs a digital phase error word $e_\Phi[n]$.

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdc_disc_time_model}
		e_\Phi[n] = \left\lfloor\frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}(\Phi_{ref}[n] - \Phi_{div}[n])\right\rfloor
	\end{equation}
	The TDC z-domain representation is equation \ref{eq:tdc_z}. For purposes of PLL loop gain calculation, the TDC transfer function is in equation \ref{eq:tdc_tf}, which accounts for phase-to-digital domain conversion gain. Effects of quantization will be handled separately in section \ref{pn_theory}.
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdc_z}
		e_\Phi(z) = \frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}(\Phi_{ref}(z) - \Phi_{div}(z))
	\end{equation}

		\mathrm{H}_{TDC}(z) = \mathrm{H}_{TDC}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}
	\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Discrete Time Loop Filter}\label{lf-discretization}
	The discrete-time loop filter design will be derived from the continuous canonical loop filter (equation \ref{eq:lf_general_form}) via application of a s-to-z domain transformation. The bilinear transform \cite{proakis_1993_bilinear} allows for such conversion from continuous transfer function to discrete representation. In the case presented in this work, the loop filter sampling rate $f_s$=$f_{ref}$ is constrained to be much greater than the PLL loop bandwidth ($f_s > 10\cdot\mathrm{BW}_{loop}$). Thus, a simpler transformation is permissible, derived through Taylor series approximation of the definition of complex variable z=$re^{s\Delta T}$ \cite{proakis_1993_z} for values on the unit circle, i.e. r=1. This will be referred to as the approximate bilinear transform in this work. Given the $1/\Delta T_s$=$f_{s}$ as the relation for sampling rate, then:
	\begin{align*}
		z^{-1} &= e^{-s\Delta T_s} && \text{(definition of z on unit circle)} \\
		&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-s\Delta T_s)^k}{k!} && \text{(exponential Taylor series)} \\
		&\approx 1-s\Delta T_s &&\text{(if $|s\Delta T_s| = 2\pi\mathrm{BW}_{loop}\cdot \Delta T_s << 1$)} \\
	\end{align*}
	Thus the s-to-z and z-to-s identities for the approximated bilinear transform are:
	\begin{align}
		z^{-1} &= 1-s\Delta T_s\\
		s &= \frac{1}{\Delta T_s}(1-z^{-1}) \label{eq:s_to_z_xfrm}
	\end{align}
	Applying equation \ref{eq:s_to_z_xfrm} to the general loop filter of equation \ref{eq:lf_general_form} yields the z-domain loop filter:
	\begin{align}
		\textnormal{H}_{LF}(z) &= \left.\textnormal{H}_{LF}(s)\right\vert_{s=\frac{1}{\Delta T_s}(1-z^{-1})} = \left.\frac{\sum_{j=0}^Z b_js^j}{\sum_{k=0}^P a_ks^k}\right\vert_{s=\frac{1}{\Delta T_s}(1-z^{-1})}\\
		&= \frac{\sum_{j=0}^Z \frac{b_j}{\Delta T_s^j}(1-z^{-1})^j}{\sum_{k=0}^P \frac{a_k}{\Delta T_k}(1-z^{-1})^k} \label{eq:z_general_lf}
	\end{align}
	Equation \ref{eq:z_general_lf} is transformed into a digitally implementable form by reorganizing into the canonical representation of equation \ref{eq:canonical_z_tf}, which then determines the tap coefficients for the sampled-time difference equation in equation \ref{eq:cananical_diff_eq}. 
	\begin{align}
		\textnormal{H}_{LF}(z) &= \frac{\sum_{j=0}^P b_j^{'}z^{-j}}{1+\sum_{k=1}^Z a_k^{'}z^{-k}}\label{eq:canonical_z_tf} \\
		y[n]&= -\sum_{k=1}^P a_k^{'}y[n-k] + \sum_{j=0}^Z b_j^{'}x[n-j] \label{eq:cananical_diff_eq}
	\end{align}
	The obtained difference equation is directly implementable in digital hardware with a direct form-I IIR filter \cite{proakis_1993} shown in figure \ref{fig:filt_implementation}. The filter coefficients $\{a_1^{'}, ..., a_P^{'}\}$ and $\{b_0^{'}, ..., b_Z^{'}\}$ must be quantized into finite resolution fixed point words for a complete digital implementation. The delay elements ($z^{-1}$ blocks) are implementable digitally as registers, the coefficient gains are implementable with array multipliers, and the adders are implementable with digital adders. Effects of quantization will be discussed in section \ref{pn_theory}.

	\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Digitally Controlled Oscillator}
	The digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) varies from a VCO by only accepting a digital frequency tuning signal, called the oscillator tuning word (OTW). A DCO is modeled in discrete time as a recursive phase integrator, dependent on (a) the DCO gain $K_{DCO}$, equal to the frequency tuning of the oscillator per LSB of the OTW, (b) the current state of the OTW u[n], and (c) the PLL sampling period $\Delta T_s$=$f_{ref}^{-1}$.
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi_{out}[n] = \Phi_{out}[n-1] + 2\pi K_{DCO}u[n]\Delta T_s
	\end{equation}
	Application of the z-transform yields equation \ref{eq:hdcoz}, and successive application of the bilinear transform to the DCO transfer function yields the continuous approximation of equation \ref{eq:hdcos}.
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hdcoz}
		\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(z) = \frac{\Phi_{out}(z)}{u(z)} = \frac{2\pi K_{DCO}\Delta T_s}{1-z^{-1}}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hdcos}
		\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(s) = \frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{u(s)} = \frac{2\pi K_{DCO}\Delta T_s}{1-(1-s\Delta T_s)} = \frac{2\pi K_{DCO}}{s} 
	\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Discrete Time PLL Transfer Function}\label{discrete_pll_tf}
	\begin{figure}[htb!]
		\center\include{./figs/discrete_pll}
		\caption{Discrete time PLL model.}
		\label{fig:discrete_pll2}
	\end{figure}
	The transfer function for the full discrete-time PLL of figure \ref{fig:discrete_pll2} can be computed in the z-domain, and also approximated continuously. The open loop z-domain transfer function is:
	\begin{align}
		\mathrm{L}(z) &= \mathrm{H}_{TDC}(z)\mathrm{H}_{LF}(z)\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(z)\mathrm{H}_{DIV}(z)
		= \frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}\frac{K_{DCO}\Delta T_s}{(1-z^{-1})}\frac{\sum_{j=0}^Z b_j(1-z^{-1})^j}{\sum_{k=0}^P a_k(1-z^{-1})^k}\label{eq:z_open_loop}
	\end{align}
	The closed loop z-domain PLL phase transfer function is:
	\begin{align}
		\mathrm{T}(z) = \frac{\Phi_{out}(z)}{\Phi_{ref}(z)} &= \frac{\mathrm{M}K_{DCO}\Delta T_s\sum_{j=0}^Z b_j(1-z^{-1})^j}{\sum_{k=0}^P a_k(1-z^{-1})^{k+1} + K_{DCO}\Delta T_s\frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}\sum_{j=0}^Z b_j(1-z^{-1})^j}%\\
		%&= \mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(z)}{1+\mathrm{L}(z)}\\
	\end{align}
	The s-domain approximation of the transfer function is:
	\begin{align}
		\mathrm{L}(s) = \mathrm{H}_{TDC}(s)\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(s)\mathrm{H}_{DIV}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}\frac{K_{DCO}}{s} \frac{\sum_{j=0}^Z b_js^j}{\sum_{k=0}^P a_ks^k}
	\end{align}
	And in closed loop configuration the s-domain PLL phase transfer function is:
	\begin{align}
		\mathrm{T}(s)=\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{\Phi_{ref}(s)} = \frac{\mathrm{M}K_{DCO}\sum_{j=0}^Z b_js^j}{\sum_{k=0}^P a_ks^{k+1} + \frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}K_{DCO}\sum_{j=0}^Z b_js^j} = \mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}
	\end{align}

\subsection{ADPLL Noise Model} \label{pn_theory}
The noise in the discrete-time ADPLL results from quantization and from stochastic sources. Quantization results from round off errors introduced in the digitization of PLL components (in the TDC, loop filter, and DCO). Stochastic noise results from thermal and flicker noise in the PLL components when considered in an analog viewpoint (present in the DCO, divider and TDC). The noise generated by these quantization sources will be discussed in the following sections.% based on a modeling and noise analysis approach from \cite{perrott_2002}.

\subsubsection{TDC Noise}\label{tdc_noise}
	The predominant noise source of within a TDC is due to quantization. This source will dominate overall noise within a PLL's closed loop bandwidth \cite{shen_2014}\cite{takinami_2011}\cite{lu_andreani_2010}, so its consideration is critical for PLL performance. As will be seen, a straightforward approach to model quantization noise is to treat it as an additive signal component as shown in figure \ref{fig:tdc_add_pn}.
	\begin{figure}[htb!]
	    \centering
	    \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
	        \centering
	        \include{./figs/tdc}

	        \label{fig:tdc1}
	    \end{subfigure}%

	        \label{fig:tdc_add_pn}
	    \end{subfigure}
	    % \caption{Approximate model for ring oscillator inverter delay cell.}
	    \label{fig:tdc_pn_model}
	    \caption{\textbf{(a)} TDC Model, \textbf{(b)} TDC additive noise model.}
	\end{figure}
	\FloatBarrier
	Suppose the quantized signal $e_\Phi$[n] out of the TDC can be represented as the sum of its unquantized representation $\Phi_e\frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}$ with a quantization error signal $\mathrm{q}_{TDC}[n]$, as in figure \ref{fig:quantization}.
	\begin{figure}[htb!]
		\center\include{./figs/quantization}
		\caption{Quantization as via additive error signal.}
		\label{fig:quantization}
	\end{figure}
	\FloatBarrier
	Based on \cite{widrow_1961}, if the quantization noise signal $\mathrm{q}_{TDC}[n]$ is uncorrelated to unquantized signal $\Phi_e\frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}$, it has the statistical property that it is uniformly distributed in the range $[-\Delta/2, \Delta/2]$, i.e. $P_q(Q=q) =\mathrm{U}(-\Delta/2, \Delta/2)$. $\Delta$ is the quantization step size. The variance, or power, of the TDC quantization noise signal is:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdc_noise}
		\sigma_{q_{TDC}}^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty q^2P_q(Q=q)dq =  \int_{-\Delta/2}^{\Delta/2}\frac{q^2}{\Delta}dq = \frac{\Delta^2}{12}
	\end{equation}
	Since $e_\Phi$[n] is a digital signal, the quantization step size is $\Delta$=1 LSB. The TDC quantization noise power is therefore $\sigma_{q_{TDC}}^2 = 1/12$ LSB$^2$. If the quantization noise is presumed to be white, and the TDC sampling rate is $f_{ref}$, the quantization noise power spectral density (PSD) is then given in equation \ref{eq:tdc_quant_psd}. 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdc_quant_psd}
		S_{qn_{TDC}}(f) = \frac{P_{q_{TDC}}}{\Delta f} = \frac{\sigma_{q_{TDC}}^2}{f_{ref}} = \frac{\Delta^2}{12f_{ref}} = \frac{1}{12f_{ref}} \hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{LSB}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}
	\end{equation}

\subsubsection{DCO Noise}\label{dco_noise}
	Noise in a DCO is resulting from (a) quantization of the oscillator tuning word u[n], and (b) from thermal and stochastic sources. In the digital PLL, the OTW quantization occurs in the loop filter, so this will be analyzed in the later loop filter section (\ref{lf_noise}). Thus oscillator thermal/stochastic noise will be considered, based on Leeson's model for oscillator phase noise \cite{leeson_1966}. Leeson's model considers noise power density at an offset $\Delta f$ from the oscillator tone (carrier). Noise power density is represented with the function $\mathcal{L}(\Delta f)$, which is the noise power density normalized to the power of the oscillator carrier tone, in other words in units of dBc/Hz. Leeson's model divides phase noise into three regions, illustrated in figure \ref{fig:leeson_pn}: (1) flicker-noise dominated, with a slope of -30 dB/decade, (2) white frequency-noise dominated, with -20 dB per decade, and (3) a flat region, limited by the thermal noise floor or amplitude noise. It is noted that phase noise components are at frequencies different than the carrier, hence are orthogonal, and can be treated as independent components that are added to the main oscillator tone signal for analysis. Figure \ref{fig:dco_noise} demonstrates the application of this principle for modeling of the DCO phase noise $\Phi_{n_{DCO}}$ as an additive process to the oscillator phase $\Phi_{osc}$, thus $\Phi_{out}$ = $\Phi_{osc}$ + $\Phi_{n_{DCO}}$.

	The equation for $\mathcal{L}(\Delta f)$ (from \cite{lee_hajimiri_2000}) is in equation \ref{eq:leesons}, and is dependent on temperature T, excess noise factor F, oscillator power P, oscillator Q factor, and the transition frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ that separate the different noise regions. It is of interest to note that the phase noise relative to the carrier will increase as power decreases, which provides challenge for creating low power oscillators with acceptable phase noise characteristics.
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:leesons}
	\mathcal{L}(\Delta f) = 10\log_{10}\left[\frac{2\text{F}k_B\text{T}}{\text{P}}\left(1+\left(\frac{f_2}{2Q\Delta f}\right)^2\right)\left(1+\frac{f_1}{|\Delta f|}\right)\right] = S_{\Phi n_{DCO}}(\Delta f)
	\end{equation}
	For notational consistency, the following redefinition is used in the remainder of this paper: $S_{\Phi n_{DCO}}(f) = \mathcal{L}(\Delta f)|_{\Delta f = f}$

\subsubsection{Divider Noise}
	\begin{figure}[htb!]
	    \centering
	    \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}

	\end{figure}
	\FloatBarrier
	Divider noise is manifested as jitter (with RMS distribution in time of $\sigma_{t n_{div}}$) on the divider output. If the divider is a digital circuit, with edge rate $dV/dt$, and subject to thermal noise in the form of an additive voltage $v_n$, with noise power of $\sigma_{v_n}^2$, the divider phase noise power added to the divider output is:
	\begin{equation}
		\sigma_{\Phi n_{div}}^2 = \omega^2_{ref}\sigma^2_{t n_{div}}  =\omega^2_{ref}\left(\frac{dV}{dt}\right)^{-2}\sigma_{v_n}^2
	\end{equation}
	At lock, the output of a digital divider will have an update rate $f_{{osc}}/\mathrm{N} \approx f_{ref}$, which can be treated as the sampling rate of the output phase signal $\Phi_{div}[n]$ as mentioned in section \ref{div_theory}. If the divider phase noise power is confined into a bandwidth equal to the PLL reference frequency $f_{ref}$, the spectral density of divider noise is:
	\begin{equation}
		S_{\Phi n_{div}}(f) = \frac{\sigma_{\Phi n_{div}}^2}{f_{ref}} = 2\pi\omega_{ref}\sigma^2_{t n_{div}}  =2\pi\omega_{ref}\left(\frac{dV}{dt}\right)^{-2}\sigma_{v_n}^2\hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{rad}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}
	\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Loop Filter Noise - Direct Form I}\label{lf_noise}
	In a digital loop filter, quantization noise arises from rounding errors due to finite precision in the digital arithmetic circuits that implement the filter \cite{proakis_1993_fwe}. Quantization noise power here will be derived under the assumption of a direct form I structure implementating the filter, with B bits in each fixed point data word throughout the digital loop filter. In a digital implementation of the canonical z-domain transfer function in equation \ref{eq:canon_z_tf} as the direct form I structure of figure \ref{fig:direct_type_1_ideal}, delays are constructed using registers, adders with digital adders, and the filter coefficient gain terms $\{a_1, ... a_N; b_0, ..., b_M\}$ with digital multipliers. The registers and adders do not introduce extra round-off error beyond that already existing (if overflows do not occur). However, the multipliers will if the products resulting from two B bit words (nominally 2B bits), are mapped back onto B bit words.
	\begin{equation}
		\textnormal{H}_{LF}(z) = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^Z b_jz^{-j}}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_kz^{-k}}\label{eq:canon_z_tf}
	\end{equation}
	\FloatBarrier
	Quantization in this case can be represented by adding a quantization error signal $q_x$[n] to the result of each ideal multiplication, as shown in figure \ref{fig:direct_type_1_quant}. This is the same approach for TDC quantization noise in section \ref{tdc_noise}. The noise power associated with each q$_x$[n] is identical, with $\sigma_{qx}^2 = 1/12$ LSB$^2$. 

	\begin{figure}[htb!]
	    \centering
	    \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
	        \centering
	        \include{./figs/direct_type_1}

	\end{figure}
	Assuming the quantization error signals of each multiplier are uncorrelated with all other multipliers, the output-referred noise power of the filter can be computed as the sum of the output-referred individual contributions. These contributions can be determined via solving for the transfer function from each quantization noise source q$_x$[n] to the output y[n]. In the case of the direct form I filter structure, all quantization sources q$_x$[n] have the same transfer characteristic to the output y[n] given in equation \ref{eq:lf_quant_tf}.
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{Y(z)}{Q_x(z)} = \frac{1}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_kz^{-k}}\label{eq:lf_quant_tf}
	\end{equation}
	Applying the bilinear transform to equation \ref{eq:lf_quant_tf}, with high oversampling where P$\cdot \text{BW}_{loop} 10 < f_{ref}$, given P is the number of poles in the system:
	\begin{equation}
		\left.\frac{Y(z)}{Q_x(z)}\right\vert_{z^{-1}=1-sT} \approx \frac{1}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_k - s\sum_{k=1}^P ka_k}\label{eq:lf_quant_tf_s}
	\end{equation}
	The output power spectral density for each error source is, confined to a bandwidth defined by the (sampling) reference frequency $f_{ref}$:
	\begin{equation}
		S_{qx}(f) = \frac{\sigma_{qx}^2}{f_{ref}}\left|\frac{Y(s)}{Q_x(s)}\right|^2_{s=j2\pi f} \approx \frac{1}{12f_{ref}}\left|\frac{1}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_k - j2\pi f\sum_{k=1}^P ka_k}\right|^2 \hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{LSB}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}
	\end{equation}
	Given P poles and Z zeros in the filter, the total output quantization PSD of the filter is in equation \ref{eq:lf_noise}. The total loop filter noise PSD linearly scales with the number of multipliers in the direct form I filter implementation.
	\begin{equation}
		S_{qn_{LF}}(f) = (P+Z+1)S_{qx}(f) \hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{LSB}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}\label{eq:lf_noise}
	\end{equation}

\subsubsection{PLL Noise Sensitivity Transfer Functions}\label{ntfs}
	Having established models for noise of generated by each PLL component, noise sensitivity transfer functions must be computed to refer each noise source to the PLL output in terms of phase. In the noise theory presented here, all noise sources have been modeled as additive signal components. The full system model including all noise sources is in figure \ref{fig:full_pll_noise}.
	\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\end{figure}

	Following the approach of \cite{perrott_2002}, it is useful to define a transfer function $\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)$ as in equation \ref{eq:parameterizing_tf} which characterizes the normalized closed loop response from reference input to output of the PLL. Normalized refers to the zero-frequency response being 1, i.e. $|\hat{\mathrm{T}}(0)|=1$. The noise transfer functions will be defined in this work in terms of $\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)$. L(s) is the PLL loop gain. 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:parameterizing_tf}
	\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}\hspace{1em} \text{s.t.} \hspace{1em} \mathrm{T}(s) = \frac{\Phi_{out}}{\Phi_{ref}} = \mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s) 
	\end{equation}
	Solving for the closed transfer functions between each noise source ($q_{n_{TDC}}$, $q_{n_{LF}}$, $\Phi_{n_{DCO}}$ and $\Phi_{n_{div}}$) to the output $\Phi_{out}$ in the s-domain yields equations \ref{eq:noise_tf_tdc}-\ref{eq:noise_tf_div}.
	\begin{align}
		\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{q_{n_{TDC}}(s)} & = \frac{2\pi\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}= 2\pi\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{M}}\frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)} = 2\pi\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{M}}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)\label{eq:noise_tf_tdc}\\
		\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{\Phi_{n_{DCO}}(s)} & = \frac{1}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}= 1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)\\
		\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{q_{n_{LF}}(s)} & = \frac{2\pi\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)} = 2\pi\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}(1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s))\\
		\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{\Phi_{n_{div}}(s)} & = \frac{\mathrm{M}\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}= \mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)} = \mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)\label{eq:noise_tf_div}
	\end{align}


\subsubsection{PLL Phase Signal and Output PSD Relationship for Noise}\label{pn_noise_psd}
	When analyzing PLL noise in hardware, the noise power spectral density of the PLL output waveform is the most relevant metric. Up to this point, noise has been defined in terms of phase signal $\Phi_{n}$, or an unwanted added component to the oscillator phase signal $\Phi_{osc}=\omega_{osc}t$. The PLL output phase signal $\Phi_{out}$ is thus:
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi_{out}(t) = \Phi_{osc}(t) + \Phi_{n}(t) = \omega_{osc}t + \Phi_{n}(t) 
	\end{equation}
	To determine the PSD of the PLL output waveform, a definition of the PLL output voltage waveform will be made in terms of a sinusoid, i.e. the real portion of a complex exponential. Given an oscillation amplitude $A_0$:
	\begin{equation}
		V_{out} = \Re\left(A_0e^{j\Phi_{out}(t)}\right) = \Re\left(A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t}e^{j\Phi_{n}(t)}\right)
	\end{equation}
	Assuming the phase noise signal is zero mean, $\mathbb{E}[\Phi_{n}(t)]=0$, and the power of phase noise signal is small, $\mathrm{Var}[\Phi_{n}(t)] << 1$, then the approximation $e^{j\Phi_{n}(t)} = 1 + j\Phi_{n}(t)$ can be applied by truncating the exponential Taylor series expansion.
	\begin{align}
		V_{out} &= \Re\left(A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t}e^{j\Phi_{n}(t)}\right) = \Re\left(A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t} +j\Phi_{n}(t)A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t}\right)\\
		&= A_0\cos(\omega_{osc}t) - \Phi_{n}(t)A_0\sin(\omega_{osc}t) \label{eq:pll_out_approx}
	\end{align}
	The result is a carrier cosine signal, and an orthogonal sine signal modulated by the phase noise $\Phi_{n}$. From this, the spectral density of the phase noise relative to the carrier can be estimated. The power spectral density $S_{V_{out}}$ is computed in equations \ref{eq:psd_vout}-\ref{eq:psd_noise}. Due to orthogonality of the sine/cosine components of equation \ref{eq:pll_out_approx}, the cross terms that appear in the PSD computation are zero. 
	\begin{align}
		S_{V_{out}}(f) =& \lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{V_{out}(t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \label{eq:psd_vout}\\
		=&\lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{A_0^2}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{\cos(\omega_{osc}t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \label{eq:psd_carrier}\\ 
		&+ \lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{A_0^2}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{\Phi_{n}(t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}*\mathcal{F}\{\sin(\omega_{osc}t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \label{eq:psd_noise}
	\end{align}
	 The noise power spectral density function of the output waveform $\mathcal{L}(\Delta f)$ is defined as the noise PSD at offset $\Delta f$ from the carrier frequency $f_{osc}$, normalized to the carrier power. Here the PSD of the carrier component is given by equation \ref{eq:psd_carrier}, and the noise component by equation \ref{eq:psd_noise}. Shifting equation \ref{eq:psd_noise} by $-\omega_{osc}$ and performing normalization for carrier power results in:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:pn_psd_relation}
		\mathcal{L}(\Delta f) = \left.\lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{\Phi_{n}(t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \right|_{f=\Delta f}= S_{\Phi_{n}}(\Delta f)
	\end{equation}

	Thus, the noise PSD $\mathcal{L}(\Delta f)$ of the PLL output waveform relative to the carrier is equal to the PSD of the phase noise signal $\Phi_{n}(t)$, provided $\text{Var}[\Phi_{n}(t)] << 1$. The PSD of $\Phi_{n}(t)$ is notated as $S_{\Phi_{n}}(\Delta f)$.

\subsubsection{PLL Output-Referred Noise PSD}\label{final_pn_model}
To compute the PLL output noise PSD, the individual PLL noise sources must be referred to the PLL output. Thus far the following have been established: (a) noise spectrum generated by each individual PLL component, (b) the PLL phase noise sensitivity functions, and (c) the relationship between output phase noise and the PSD of the PLL output waveform. These can be combined to provide a final result for total PLL output-referred noise PSD. An assumption here is all noise sources are uncorrelated, so their independent noise power contributions may be summed to find the total noise PSD. The PLL output phase noise PSD for each noise source is simply found by multiplying the magnitude squared of the respective noise sensitivity function with the noise source PSD. Thus:
\begin{align}
	S_{\Phi n_{TDC,out}}(f) &= S_{qn_{TDC}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{q_{n_{TDC}}(f)}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{12f_{ref}}\left|2\pi\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{M}}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)\right|^2\label{eq:tdc_pn_psd}\\
	S_{\Phi n_{DCO,out}}(f) &= S_{\Phi n_{DCO}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{\Phi_{n_{DCO}}(f)}\right|^2  = \frac{S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}}{f^2}\left|1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)\right|^2\\		
	S_{\Phi n_{LF,out}}(f) &= S_{q n_{LF}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{q_{n_{LF}}(f)}\right|^2 \approx \frac{K_{DCO}^2}{12f_{ref}f^2}\frac{(P+Z+1)|1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)|^2}{\left|1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_k - j2\pi f\sum_{k=1}^P ka_k\right|^2}\\
	S_{\Phi n_{div,out}}(f) &= S_{\Phi n_{div}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{\Phi_{n_{div}}(f)}\right|^2 = f_{ref}\left|2\pi\sigma_{tn_{div}}\mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)\right|^2\label{eq:div_pn_psd}\
\end{align}
The final PLL output noise PSD at offset $\Delta f$ relative to the carrier frequency and normalized to carrier power of PLL will be:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}(\Delta f) = S_{\Phi n_{TDC,out}}(\Delta f) + S_{\Phi n_{DCO,out}}(\Delta f) + S_{\Phi n_{LF,out}}(\Delta f) + S_{\Phi n_{div,out}}(\Delta f)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Bang-bang phase detector PLL}\label{bbpd_theory}

	\label{fig:bbpll}
\end{figure}
An alternative digital phase detector that is not resolution limited like a TDC is the bang-bang phase detector (BBPD) \cite{zanuso_2009}. A BBPD is implemented in a PLL as shown in figure \ref{fig:bbpll}. The BBPD in principle functions by outputting a 1 if the divider signal is late relative to the clock, and -1 if it is early. A BBPD exhibits hard nonlinearity in its transfer characteristics. However, as shown in \cite{xu_abidi_2017}, a linearized model for BBPD gain can be established, given in equation \ref{eq:nom_bbpd_gain} if the signal variance $\sigma_{\Phi_e}^2$ into the detector is constant. Here the input to the detector is phase error signal $\Phi_e=\Phi_{CLK}-\Phi_{DIV}$ and the output $\mathrm{y}$ valued as $\pm 1$ (its variance $\sigma_y^2$=1).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nom_bbpd_gain}
	K = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\Phi_e(t)\cdot\mathrm{y}(t)]}{\mathbb{E}[\Phi_e^2(t)]} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\frac{1}{\sigma_{\Phi_e}}
\end{equation}
The noise power of the BBPD can be determined as $\sigma_{n_{BBPD}}^2$ = $\sigma_y^2$ - $K^2\sigma_{\Phi_e}^2$ = $1-\frac{2}{\pi}$. It is observed that the BBPD noise power is fixed, unlike the TDC, which can reduce the limitations on detector phase noise compared to the quantization prone TDC. Given the BBPD samples the divider phase at a rate equal to $f_{ref}$, the BBPD noise spectral density is in equation \ref{eq:bbpd_noise_psd}. The gain of the BBPD, however, changes with input signal variance, which affects the PLL loop gain and thus closed loop PLL response. The variance of the signal into the phase detector should be expected to vary across PLL process, voltage and temperature conditions, thus the BBPD is limited in terms of gain accuracy. The linearized gain and noise values determined here can be substituted for the TDC model established for PLL transfer function and phase noise in sections \ref{adpll_model} and \ref{pn_theory} to solve for BBPD-PLL dynamics. This yields the closed loop response of equation \ref{eq:cl_bbpd_pll}, the noise transfer function in equation \ref{eq:ntf_bbpd_pll}, and the output-referred noise spectral density in equation \ref{eq:out_psd_bbpd_pll}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bbpd_noise_psd}
	S_{ n_{BBPD}(f)} = \frac{\sigma_{n_{BBPD}}^2}{\Delta f} = \frac{\left(1-\frac{2}{\pi}\right)}{f_{ref}}
\end{equation}
	\begin{align}\label{eq:cl_bbpd_pll}
		\mathrm{T}(s)=\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{\Phi_{ref}(s)} = \frac{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\frac{1}{\sigma_{\Phi_e}}K_{DCO}\sum_{j=0}^Z b_js^j}{\sum_{k=0}^P a_ks^{k+1} + 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\frac{\mathrm{1}}{\sigma_{\Phi_e}\mathrm{N}}K_{DCO}\sum_{j=0}^Z b_js^j} = \mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}
	\end{align}
\begin{align}\label{eq:ntf_bbpd_pll}
	\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{n_{{BBPD}}(f)} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sigma_{\Phi_e}\mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(f)}{1+\mathrm{L}(f)} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sigma_{\Phi_e}\mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)
\end{align}
\begin{align}\label{eq:out_psd_bbpd_pll}
	S_{\Phi n_{BBPD,out}}(f) &= S_{n_{BBPD}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{q_{n_{BBPD}}(f)}\right|^2 = \frac{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-1\right)}{f_{ref}}\left|\sigma_{\Phi_e}\mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)\right|^2
