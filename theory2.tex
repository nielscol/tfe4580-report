\subsection{ADPLL - digital, discretized PLL Model}
	Based on the continuous PLL theory, a model for digital, discretized PLLs (i.e. ADPLLs) can be adapted. The general approach here is to utilize the bilinear transformation between continuous s-domain models to the discrete z-domain models. As commonly cited in PLL literature from a seminal paper by Gardner \cite{gardner_1980}, if the sampling frequency $f_s > 10\cdot\textnormal{BW}_{loop}$, where BW$_{loop}$ is the PLL loop bandwidth, the effects of time sampling are easily ignored for purposes of analysis. Thus the design methods established in this paper are predicated on $f_s > 10\cdot\textnormal{BW}_{loop}$.

	\end{figure}
	\FloatBarrier
	The basic architecture of an ADPLL is shown in figure \ref{fig:basic_adpll}. Here, compared to the continuous PLL, the phase detector has been replaced with a time to digital converter (TDC), the loop filter $\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)$ with a discrete loop filter $\mathrm{H}_{LF}(z)$, and the VCO with a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). In this architecture, the TDC, loop filter, and DCO are digital. 

	\subsubsection{Divider}
		A digital divider functions by counting input cycles. With a divider modulus N, the output of the divider will have an active edge transition (considered to be rising edge as shown here) every N-cycles. Phase information is inferred from active edge timing, which occurs with time interval N$/f_{osc}$, and is equal to the point at which output phase equals a multiple of $2\pi$. Thus a digital divider does not provider continuous phase information, but rather a sampled phase signal with rate $f_{osc}/$N. 
		\begin{figure}[htb!]
			\center\include{./figs/digital_div}
			\caption{Digital divider signals.}
			\label{fig:gigital_div}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		For PLL transfer function modeling, a digital divider behaves identically to the continuous case:
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi_{div}[n] = \frac{\Phi_{out}[n]}{\mathrm{N}}
		\end{equation}
		Application of the z- and s-domain transformations:
		\begin{equation}
			\mathrm{H}_{div}(z) = \mathrm{H}_{div}(s) = \frac{\Phi_{div}(z)}{\Phi_{out}(z)} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{N}}
		\end{equation}

	\subsubsection{TDC}
		The TDC is a digital, quantized representation of the the phase detector. It takes input phase signals $\Phi_{div}$[n] and $\Phi_{ref}$[n], and outputs a digital phase error word $e_\Phi[n]$. Figure \ref{fig:tdc} shows the basic TDC model architecture. Being digitized, a TDC will have limited resolution in phase, equivalent to M steps per reference cycle. This is a minimum step size in time of $\Delta t_{step}$ = $1/Mf_{ref}$. Since the output of the TDC is digital, the model applies a scale factor M$/2\pi$ and floor rounding, so 1 least significant bit (LSB) of $e_\Phi[n]$ equates to $\Delta t_{step}$ timing error  between $\Phi_{div}$[n] and $\Phi_{ref}$[n].
		\begin{figure}[htb!]
			\center\include{./figs/tdc}
			\caption{TDC model.}
			\label{fig:tdc}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		In sampled-time equation form:
		\begin{equation}
			e_\Phi[n] = \left\lfloor\frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}(\Phi_{ref}[n] - \Phi_{div}[n])\right\rfloor
		\end{equation}
		For purposes of PLL transfer function calculation, the TDC z- and s-domain representation is equation \ref{eq:tdc_tf}, which accounts for phase-to-digital domain conversion gain. Effects of quantization will be handled in section \ref{pn_theory}.
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdc_tf}
			e_\Phi(z) = \frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}(\Phi_{ref}(z) - \Phi_{div}(z))
		\end{equation}	
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdc_tf}
			\mathrm{H}_{TDC}(z) = \mathrm{H}_{TDC}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}
		\end{equation}	
		\FloatBarrier

	\subsubsection{Loop Filter}
		The loop filter design will be derived from the continuous PI-controller loop filter with optional peaking compensation (equation \ref{eq:pi_compensated_tf}) via application of the bilinear transform. The bilinear transform specifically allows for the conversion of a continuous transfer function to discrete representation, and vice versa. This, however is conditioned on satisfaction of Nyquist sampling criteria, and in the case of PLLs it is recommended that $f_s > 10\cdot\mathrm{BW}_{loop}$ to ensure transformation accuracy \cite{gardner_1980}. A high level of oversampling allows for the following definition of the bilinear transform, where $1/\Delta T_s$=$f_{ref}$:
		\begin{align*}
			z^{-1} &= e^{-s\Delta T_s} && \text{(definition of z-space)} \\
			&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-s\Delta T_s)^k}{k!} && \text{(exponential Taylor series)} \\
			&\approx 1-s\Delta T_s &&\text{(if $|s\Delta T_s| = 2\pi\mathrm{BW}_{loop}\cdot \Delta T_s << 1$)} \\
		\end{align*}
		Thus the bilinear transform identities are:
		\begin{align}
			z^{-1} &= 1-s\Delta T_s\\
			s &= \frac{1}{\Delta T_s}(1-z^{-1}) \label{eq:s_to_z}
		\end{align}
		Applying \ref{eq:s_to_z} to equation \ref{eq:pi_compensated_tf} yields the z-domain loop filter:
		\begin{align}
			\textnormal{H}_{LF}(z) &= \left.\textnormal{H}_{LF}(s)\right\vert_{s=\frac{1}{\Delta T_s}(1-z^{-1})} = \left.\frac{K_i}{s}\frac{\left(\frac{s}{\omega_z} + 1\right)}{\left(\frac{s}{\omega_p} + 1\right)}\right\vert_{s=\frac{1}{\Delta T_s}(1-z^{-1})}\\
			&= k_i\Delta T_s\frac{\omega_p}{\omega_z}\frac{(1+\omega_z\Delta T_s)-z^{-1}}{(1+\omega_p\Delta T_s) - z^{-1}(2+\omega_p\Delta T_s) + z^{-2}}\label{eq:z_lf}
		\end{align}
		Equation \ref{eq:z_lf} is transformed to a digitally implementable representation by converting into the canonical representation of \ref{eq:canonical_z}, which then determines the tap coefficients for the sampled-time difference equation \ref{eq:cananical_diff}. 
		\begin{align}
			\textnormal{H}_{LF}(z) &= \frac{\sum_{j=0}^M b_jz^{-j}}{1+\sum_{k=1}^N a_kz^{-k}}\label{eq:canonical_z} \\
			y[n]&= -\sum_{k=1}^N a_ky[n-k] + \sum_{j=0}^M b_jx[n-j] \label{eq:cananical_diff}
		\end{align}
		The transformed \ref{eq:z_lf} is directly implementable in digital hardware with a direct type 1 IIR filter shown in figure \ref{fig:filt_imple}, with the filter coefficients given by equations \ref{eq:a1}-\ref{eq:b1}. The filter coefficients must be quantized into finite resolution fixed point words for a complete digital implementation. Effects of quantization will be discussed in section \ref{pn_theory}.
		\begin{figure}[htb!]

					% y[n] = x[n]\frac{K_i\omega_pT}{\omega_z}\frac{1+\omega_zT}{1+\omega_pT} - x[n-1]\frac{K_i\omega_pT}{\omega_z}\frac{1}{1+\omega_pT} + y[n-1]\frac{2+\omega_pT}{1+\omega_pT} - y[n-2]\frac{1}{1+\omega_pT}\\
					% = a_0x[n] + a_1x[n-1] - b_1y[n-1] - b_2x[n-2] 
		\begin{align}
			a_1 &= -\frac{2+\omega_p\Delta T_s}{1+\omega_p\Delta T_s}\label{eq:a1}\\
			a_2 &= \frac{1}{1+\omega_p\Delta T_s} \\
			b_0 &= \frac{K_i\omega_p\Delta T_s}{\omega_z}\frac{1+\omega_z\Delta T_s}{1+\omega_p\Delta T_s}\\
			b_1 &= \frac{K_i\omega_p\Delta T_s}{\omega_z}\frac{1}{1+\omega_p\Delta T_s}\label{eq:b1}
		\end{align}

	\subsubsection{DCO}
		The digitally controlled oscillator varies from a VCO by only accepting a digital (quantized) frequency tuning signal, called the oscillator tuning word (OTW). A DCO modeled in discrete time as a recursive phase integrator, dependent on (a) the DCO gain $K_{DCO}$, equal to the frequency tuning of the oscillator per OTW LSB , (b) the digital OTW u[n], and (c) the sampling period T=$f_{ref}^{-1}$.
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi_{out}[n] = \Phi_{out}[n-1] + 2\pi K_{DCO}u[n]\Delta T_s
		\end{equation}
		Application of the z-transform yields:
		\begin{equation}
			\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(z) = \frac{\Phi_{out}(z)}{u(z)} = \frac{2\pi K_{DCO}\Delta T_s}{1-z^{-1}}
		\end{equation}
		Application of the bilinear transform to the DCO transfer function yields:
		\begin{equation}
			\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(s) = \frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{u(s)} = \frac{2\pi K_{DCO}\Delta T_s}{1-(1-s\Delta T_s)} = \frac{2\pi K_{DCO}}{s} 
		\end{equation}

	\subsubsection{Discrete-time PLL transfer function}
		\begin{figure}[htb!]
			\center\include{./figs/discrete_pll}
			\caption{Discrete time PLL model.}
			\label{fig:discrete_pll2}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		The transfer function for the discrete-time PLL can be computed in the z-domain, and also approximated continuously. The open loop z-domain transfer function is:
		\begin{align}
			\mathrm{L}(z) &= \mathrm{H}_{TDC}(z)\mathrm{H}_{LF}(z)\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(z)\mathrm{H}_{DIV}(z) \\
			&= 2\pi K_{DCO}K_i\Delta T_s^2\frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}\frac{\omega_p}{\omega_z}\frac{(1+\omega_z\Delta T_s)-z^{-1}}{(1+\omega_p\Delta T_s) - z^{-1}(3+2\omega_p\Delta T_s) + z^{-2}(3+\omega_p\Delta T_s) - z^{-3}}\label{eq:z_open_loop}
		\end{align}
		The closed loop z-domain PLL phase transfer function is:
		\begin{align}
			\mathrm{T}(z) = \frac{\Phi_{out}(z)}{\Phi_{ref}(z)} &= \frac{2\pi K_{DCO}K_i\Delta T_s^2\mathrm{M}\frac{\omega_p}{\omega_z}(1+\omega_z\Delta T_s)-z^{-1}}{\left(\parbox{4.2in}{$(1+\omega_p\Delta T_s + 2\pi K_{DCO}K_i\Delta T_s^2\frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}\frac{\omega_p}{\omega_z}(1+\omega_z\Delta T_s))- z^{-1}(3+2\omega_p\Delta T_s+2\pi K_{DCO}K_i\Delta T_s^2\frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}\frac{\omega_p}{\omega_z})+ z^{-2}(3+\omega_p\Delta T_s) - z^{-3}$}\right)}%\\
			%&= \mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(z)}{1+\mathrm{L}(z)}\\
		\end{align}
		The s-domain approximation of the transfer function is:
		\begin{align}
			\mathrm{L}(s) = \mathrm{H}_{TDC}(s)\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)\mathrm{H}_{DCO}(s)\mathrm{H}_{DIV}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}\frac{K_{DCO}K_i}{s^2} \frac{\left(\frac{s}{\omega_z} + 1\right)}{\left(\frac{s}{\omega_p} + 1\right)}
		\end{align}
		And in closed loop configuration the s-domain PLL phase transfer function is:
		\begin{align}
			\mathrm{T}(s)=\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{\Phi_{ref}(s)} = \frac{\mathrm{M}K_{DCO}K_i\left(\frac{s}{\omega_z} + 1\right)}{s^3\frac{1}{\omega_z} + s^2 + \frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{N}}K_{DCO}K_i\left(\frac{s}{\omega_z} + 1\right)} = \mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}
		\end{align}
		Incidentally, the s-domain approximation is significantly simpler and will is preferred in this paper for purposes of analysis.

\subsection{ADPLL Noise Model} \label{pn_theory}
	The predominant sources of noise in the discrete-time ADPLL are chiefly quantization (in the TDC, loop filter, and DCO), along with thermal noise (in the DCO, divider and TDC). The noise generated by these quantization sources will be discussed in the following sections.

	\subsubsection{TDC noise}\label{tdc_noise}
		The predominant phase noise source in the TDC is due to quantization. A straightforward approach to model quantization noise is to utilize the model of figure \ref{fig:tdc_add_pn} to represent quantization.
		\begin{figure}[htb!]
		    \centering

		    \label{fig:tdc_pn_model}
		    \caption{TDC quantization noise models.}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		Using this model, the quantized signal $e_\Phi$[n] is the sum of the its unquantized representation $\Phi_e\frac{\mathrm{M}}{2\pi}$ with a quantization error signal $\mathrm{q}_{TDC}[n]$. Figure \ref{fig:quantization} illustrates this process.
		\begin{figure}[htb!]
			\center\include{./figs/quantization}
			\caption{Quantization as via additive error signal.}
			\label{fig:quantization}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		The quantization noise signal has the statistical property that it is uniformly distributed in the range $[-\Delta/2, \Delta/2]$, i.e. $P_q(Q=q) =\mathrm{U}(-\Delta/2, \Delta/2)$ if $\Delta$ is the quantization step size. The power of the TDC quantization noise signal is:
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdc_noise}
			\sigma_{q_{TDC}}^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty q^2P_q(Q=q)dq =  \int_{-\Delta/2}^{\Delta/2}\frac{q^2}{\Delta}dq = \frac{\Delta^2}{12}
		\end{equation}
		Since $e_\Phi$[n] is digital signal, the minimum step size is $\Delta$=1 LSB. The TDC quantization noise power is therefore $\sigma_{q_{TDC}}^2 = 1/12$ LSB$^2$. The po
		If the quantization noise is assumed to be white, and the TDC is sampled at $f_{ref}$, the quantization PSD is:
		\begin{equation}
			S_{qn_{TDC}}(f) = \frac{P_{q_{TDC}}}{\Delta f} = \frac{\sigma_{q_{TDC}}^2}{f_{ref}} = \frac{\Delta^2}{12f_{ref}} = \frac{1}{12f_{ref}} \hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{LSB}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}
		\end{equation}

	\subsubsection{DCO noise}
		\hl{Add connection of DCO noise to random phase walk, cite Leeson}

		Noise in a DCO is resulting from (a) quantization of the oscillator tuning word u[n], and (b) from thermal and stochastic sources. In the digital PLL, the OTW quantization occurs in the loop filter, so this will be analyzed in the later loop filter section (\ref{lf_noise}). Thus oscillator thermal/stochastic noise will be considered, to develop a phase noise model where oscillator phase noise $\Phi_{n_{DCO}}$ is an additive process to the oscillator phase $\Phi_{osc}$, thus $\Phi_{out}$ = $\Phi_{osc} + \Phi_{n_{DCO}}$.

		\begin{figure}[htb!]
			\center\include{./figs/dco_noise}
			\caption{DCO additive noise model.}
			\label{fig:dco_noise}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier

		 Oscillator phase noise due to stochastic and uncorrelated circuit and supply noise can be analyzed as additive voltage disturbance $\delta v_n$ with variance $\sigma_{v_n}^2$ to the oscillator waveform $V_{osc}$ at any given time.  In a stable, noiseless oscillator, amplitude is inherently tied to signal phase, i.e. $V_{osc}(\Phi=\omega t)$. With additive noise, given $\frac{dV_{osc}(\Phi)}{d\Phi}$ is finite $\forall$t, a small voltage disturbance from noise $\delta v_{n}$ will be coupled as a disturbance $\delta\Phi_{n}$ in the oscillator phase, shown in figure \ref{fig:aperture_noise}. The phase evolution of the noisy oscillator for an infinitesimal time increment $\delta t$  with such a disturbance is:
		 \begin{equation}
			\Phi_{out}(t+\delta t) = \Phi_{out}(t) + \delta\Phi_n + \omega_{osc}\delta t \label{eq:rwalk_ph}
		 \end{equation}

		\begin{figure}[htb!]
			\center\include{./figs/aperture_noise}
			\caption{Voltage to phase noise conversion.}
			\label{fig:aperture_noise}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		  Assuming $\delta v_n$ is Gaussian white noise, $\delta\Phi_{n}$ is sampled stochastically at any instant based on the probability distribution \ref{eq:osc_rw_dist}, dependent on the current oscillator phase $\Phi_{out}$ and the noiseless voltage-phase relation $V_{osc}(\Phi)$. It will be assumed that like the source noise $\delta v_n$, $\delta\Phi_{n}$ is white spectrum.
		 \begin{equation}
		 	P(\delta\Phi_{n}|\Phi_{out}) = \text{Norm}\left(\mu=0, \sigma=\sigma_{v_n}\left(\left.\frac{dV_{osc}(\Phi)}{d\Phi}\right\vert_{\Phi=\Phi_{out}}\right)^{-1}\right) \label{eq:osc_rw_dist}
		 \end{equation} 
		Spectral analysis of the noisy oscillator phase can be made utilizing discrete time-modeling. Converting \ref{eq:rwalk_ph} into a sampled signal with time step $\delta t$ 
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi_{out}[n+1] = \Phi_{out}[n] + \omega_{osc}\delta t + \delta\Phi_n[n|\Phi_{out}[n]]
		\end{equation}
		Computing the z-transform, and splitting the result into the oscillation $\Phi_{osc}$ and phase noise $\Phi_{n}$ components:
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi_{out}(z) = \frac{\omega_{osc}\delta t}{z-1} + \frac{\delta\Phi_n(z)}{z-1} = \Phi_{osc}(z) + \Phi_{n}(z)
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\Rightarrow \Phi_{n}(z) = \frac{\delta\Phi_n(z)}{z-1} \label{eq:z_osc_pn}
		\end{equation}
		Application of the bilinear transform to \ref{eq:z_osc_pn} can be used to approximate the continuous phase noise spectrum, if $s=j\omega$
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi_{n}(s) = \left.\Phi_{n}(z)\right\vert_{z=1-s\delta t} = \left.\frac{\delta\Phi_n(z)}{z-1}\right\vert_{z=1+s\delta t} = \frac{\delta\Phi_n(s)}{s\delta t}
		\end{equation}
		The phase noise PSD is therefore:
		\begin{equation}
			S_{\Phi n_{DCO}}(f)= \lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\Delta T}\left|\frac{\delta\Phi_n(j2\pi f)}{j2\pi f \delta t}*\mathcal{F}\left\{\text{rect}\left(\frac{t}{\Delta t}\right)\right\}\right|^2  =  \frac{S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}}{f^2}
		\end{equation}
		Following that the phase disturbance signal $\delta\Phi_{n}(t)$ is white spectrum, a constant value for its PSD $S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}$ can be defined. The value for $S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}$ is highly dependent on implementation and is best extracted by means of curve fitting simulation or physical measurement.
	
	\subsubsection{Divider noise}
		\begin{figure}[htb!]
		    \centering
		    \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
		        \centering
		        \include{./figs/div_noise_model}

		    \caption{Divider phase noise.}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		Divider noise is manifested as jitter (with RMS distribution in time of $\sigma_{t n_{div}}$) on the the divider output. This is due to effects of stochastic and uncorrelated voltage noise coupling into the signal phase, much like in the case of oscillator phase noise. If the divider is a digital circuit, with edge rate $dV/dt$, and subject to thermal noise in the form of a  voltage $v_n$, with noise power of $\sigma_{v_n}^2$, the divider phase noise power added to the divider output is:
		\begin{equation}
			\sigma_{\Phi n_{div}}^2 = \omega^2_{ref}\sigma^2_{t n_{div}}  =\omega^2_{ref}\left(\frac{dV}{dt}\right)^{-2}\sigma_{v_n}^2
		\end{equation}
		At lock, the output of a digital divider will have an update rate $f_{{osc}}/\mathrm{N} \approx f_{ref}$, which can be treated as the sampling rate of the output phase signal $\Phi_{div}[n]$. Thus if the divider phase noise power is confined into a bandwidth equal to $f_{ref}$, the spectral density of divider noise is:
		\begin{equation}
			S_{\Phi n_{div}}(f) = \frac{\sigma_{\Phi n_{div}}^2}{f_{ref}} = 2\pi\omega_{ref}\sigma^2_{t n_{div}}  =2\pi\omega_{ref}\left(\frac{dV}{dt}\right)^{-2}\sigma_{v_n}^2\hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{rad}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}
		\end{equation}

	\subsubsection{Loop filter noise - direct type I}\label{lf_noise}
		In a digital loop filter, quantization noise arises from rounding errors due to finite precision in the arithmetic circuits that implement the filter. Quantization noise power here will be derived under the assumption of a direct type-I filter implementation, with B bits in each fixed point word throughout the loop filter. In a digital implementation of the canonical z-domain transfer function \ref{eq:canon_z_tf} as the direct type-I structure of figure \ref{fig:direct_type_1_ideal}, delays are constructed using registers, adders with digital adders, and the filter coefficient gain terms $\{a_1, ... a_N; b_0, ..., b_M\}$ with digital multipliers. The registers and adders do not introduce extra round-off error beyond that already existing, however the multipliers will if the products of B bit words, yielding 2B bits, are mapped onto B bit words. 
		\begin{equation}
			\textnormal{H}_{LF}(z) = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^Z b_jz^{-j}}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_kz^{-k}}\label{eq:canon_z_tf}
		\end{equation}
		\FloatBarrier
		Quantization in this case can be represented by adding a quantization error signal $q_x$[n] to the result of each ideal multiplication, as shown in figure \ref{fig:direct_type_1_quant}. This is the same approach for TDC quantization noise in section \ref{eq:tdc_noise}. The noise power associated with each q$_x$[n] is identical, with $\sigma_{qx}^2 = 1/12$ LSB$^2$.

		Assuming the quantization error signals of each multiplier are uncorrelated with all other multipliers, the output-referred noise power of the filter can be computed as the sum of the output-referred individual contributions. These contributions can be determined via solving for the transfer function from each source q$_x$[n] of each quantization noise to the output y[n]. In the case of the direct type I filter structure, all quantization sources q$_x$[n] have the same transfer characteristic to the output y[n]:
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{Y(z)}{Q_x(z)} = \frac{1}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_kz^{-k}}\label{eq:lf_quant_tf}
		\end{equation}
		Applying the bilinear transform to \ref{eq:lf_quant_tf}, with high oversampling where N$\cdot \text{BW}_{loop} 10 < f_{ref}$, and N is the number of poles in the system.
		\begin{equation}
			\left.\frac{Y(z)}{Q_x(z)}\right\vert_{z^{-1}=1-sT} \approx \frac{1}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_k - s\sum_{k=1}^P ka_k}\label{eq:lf_quant_tf_s}
		\end{equation}
		The output power spectral density is then for one error source is, confined to a bandwidth defined by the (sampling) reference frequency $f_{ref}$:
		\begin{equation}
			S_{qx}(f) = \frac{\sigma_{qx}^2}{f_{ref}}\left|\frac{Y(s)}{Q_x(s)}\right|^2_{s=j2\pi f} \approx \frac{1}{12f_{ref}}\left|\frac{1}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_k - j2\pi f\sum_{k=1}^P ka_k}\right|^2\label{eq:lf_quant_tf_s} \hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{LSB}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}
		\end{equation}
		Given P poles and Z zeros in the filter, the total output quantization PSD of the filter is \ref{eq:lf_noise}. The total loop filter noise PSD linearly scales with the number of multipliers in the direct type-I filter implementation.
		\begin{equation}
			S_{qn_{LF}}(f) = (P+Z+1)S_{qx}(f) \hspace{1em}\frac{[\text{LSB}]^2}{[\text{Hz}]}\label{eq:lf_noise}
		\end{equation}

	\subsubsection{PLL noise sensitivity transfer functions}
		Having developed models for noise of generated by each PLL component, noise sensitivity transfer functions must be computer to refer each noise source to the PLL output in terms of phase. In the developed noise theory, thus far all noise sources have been modeled as additive phase components. The full system model illustrating this is:

		It is useful to define a transfer function $\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)$ which characterizes the normalized closed loop response from reference to output of the PLL. $\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)$ is defined in terms of the loop gain L(s).
		\begin{equation}
		\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}\hspace{1em} \text{s.t.} \hspace{1em} \mathrm{T}(s) = \frac{\Phi_{out}}{\Phi_{ref}} = \mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s) 
		\end{equation}
		Solving for the closed transfer functions between each $q_{n_{TDC}}$, $q_{n_{LF}}$, $\Phi_{n_{DCO}}$ and $\Phi_{n_{div}}$ to the output $\Phi_{out}$ utilizing s-domain approximations yield:
		\begin{align}
			\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{q_{n_{TDC}}(s)} & = \frac{2\pi\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}= 2\pi\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{M}}\frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)} = 2\pi\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{M}}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)\\
			\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{\Phi_{n_{DCO}}(s)} & = \frac{1}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}= 1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)\\
			\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{q_{n_{LF}}(s)} & = \frac{2\pi\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)} = 2\pi\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}(1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s))\\
			\frac{\Phi_{out}(s)}{\Phi_{n_{div}}(s)} & = \frac{\mathrm{M}\frac{K_{DCO}}{s}\mathrm{H}_{LF}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)}= \mathrm{N}\frac{\mathrm{L}(s)}{1+\mathrm{L}(s)} = \mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(s)

	\subsubsection{PLL phase noise and output PSD relationship}\label{pn_noise_psd}
		When analyzing PLL noise, the noise power spectral density of the PLL output is of most interest. Up to this point, noise has been defined in terms of phase noise $\Phi_{n}$, or an unwanted added component to the oscillator phase signal $\Phi_{osc}=\omega_{osc}t$. The PLL output phase signal $\Phi_{out}$ is thus:
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi_{out}(t) = \Phi_{osc}(t) + \Phi_{n}(t) = \omega_{osc}t + \Phi_{n}(t) 
		\end{equation}
		Computation of PSD requires the PLL output voltage waveforms. These here will be defined in terms of complex exponentials. Given an oscillation amplitude $A_0$:
		\begin{equation}
			V_{out} = \Re\left(A_0e^{j\Phi_{out}(t)}\right) = \Re\left(A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t}e^{j\Phi_{n}(t)}\right)
		\end{equation}
		Assuming the phase noise signal is zero mean, $\mathbb{E}[\Phi_{n}(t)]=0$, and the power of phase noise signal is small, $\mathrm{Var}[\Phi_{n}(t)] << 1$, then the approximation $e^{j\Phi_{n}(t)} = 1 + j\Phi_{n}(t)$ can be applied by truncating the exponential Taylor series expansion.
		\begin{align}
			V_{out} &= \Re\left(A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t}e^{j\Phi_{n}(t)}\right) = \Re\left(A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t} +j\Phi_{n}(t)A_0e^{j\omega_{osc}t}\right)\\
			&= A_0\cos(\omega_{osc}t) - \Phi_{n}(t)A_0\sin(\omega_{osc}t) \label{eq:pll_out_approx}
		\end{align}
		The result is a carrier cosine signal, and an orthogonal sine signal modulated by the phase noise $\Phi_{n}$. From this, the spectral density of the phase noise relative to the carrier can be estimated. The power spectral density $S_{V_{out}}$ is computed in \ref{eq:psd_vout}-\ref{eq:psd_noise}. Due to orthogonality of the sine/cosine components of \ref{eq:pll_out_approx}, the cross terms that appear in the PSD are zero. 
		\begin{align}
			S_{V_{out}} =& \lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{V_{out}(t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \label{eq:psd_vout}\\
			=&\lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{A_0^2}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{\cos(\omega_{osc}t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \label{eq:psd_carrier}\\ 
			&+ \lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{A_0^2}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{\Phi_{n}(t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}*\mathcal{F}\{\sin(\omega_{osc}t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \label{eq:psd_noise}
		\end{align}
		 Single side band (SSB) noise power spectral density $\mathcal{L}(\Delta f)$ is defined as the phase noise PSD at offset $\Delta f$ from the carrier frequency $f_{osc}$, normalized to the carrier power. Here the PSD carrier component is given by \ref{eq:psd_carrier}, and the noise component by \ref{eq:psd_noise}.
		\begin{equation}
			\mathcal{L}(\Delta f) = \left.\lim_{\Delta T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\Delta T}|\mathcal{F}\{\Phi_{n}(t)\cdot\mathrm{rect}(t/\Delta T)\}|^2 \right|_{f=\Delta f}= S_{\Phi_{n}}(\Delta f)
		\end{equation}

		Thus, the PLL output noise PSD relative to the carrier is equal to the PSD $S_{\Phi_{n}}(\Delta f)$ of the phase noise signal $\Phi_{n}(t)$.

	\subsubsection{PLL output-referred noise PSD}
	In terms of analysis, PLL noise PSD referred to the PLL output is of most interest. Thus far the following have been established: (a) noise spectrum generated by each individual PLL component, (b) the PLL phase noise sensitivity functions, and (c) the relationship between PLL output PSD and output phase noise. Now these can be combined to provide a final result for full PLL output-referred noise PSD. An important assumption here is all noise sources are uncorrelated, so their independent noise power contributions may be summed to find the total noise PSD. The PLL output phase noise PSD for each noise source is simply found by multiplying magnitude squared of the respective noise sensitivity function with the noise source PSD. Thus:
	\begin{align}
		S_{\Phi n_{TDC,out}}(f) &= S_{qn_{TDC}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{q_{n_{TDC}}(f)}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{12f_{ref}}\left|2\pi\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{M}}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)\right|^2\\
		S_{\Phi n_{DCO,out}}(f) &= S_{\Phi n_{DCO}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{\Phi_{n_{DCO}}(f)}\right|^2  = \frac{S_{0\Phi n_{DCO}}}{f^2}\left|1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)\right|^2\\		
		S_{\Phi n_{LF,out}}(f) &= S_{q n_{LF}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{q_{n_{LF}}(f)}\right|^2 \approx \frac{K_{DCO}^2}{12f_{ref}f^2}\left|\frac{1-\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)}{1+\sum_{k=1}^P a_k - j2\pi f\sum_{k=1}^P ka_k}\right|^2\\
		S_{\Phi n_{div,out}}(f) &= S_{\Phi n_{div}}(f)\left|\frac{\Phi_{out}(f)}{\Phi_{n_{div}}(f)}\right|^2 = f_{ref}\left|2\pi\sigma_{tn_{div}}\mathrm{N}\hat{\mathrm{T}}(f)\right|^2
	\end{align}
	The output SSB noise PSD at offset $\Delta f$ relative to the carrier normalized to carrier power of PLL will be:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{L}(\Delta f) = S_{\Phi n_{TDC,out}}(\Delta f) + S_{\Phi n_{DCO,out}}(\Delta f) + S_{\Phi n_{LF,out}}(\Delta f) + S_{\Phi n_{div,out}}(\Delta f)
	\end{equation}

	% Out PSD = Noise PSD * |(TF from source to output)|^2

	% out PSD = sum of individual PSDs
