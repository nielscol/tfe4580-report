Discuss choices for loop filter optimizer (loop filter type)
	how was loop filter transfer function prototype arrived at?
	ie what is the best loop filter design

Compare to state of art (perrot)
Perrot's pre-existing work: general purpuse simulation architecture, doesn't directly handle optimization for integer-N

Talk about why DCO flicker noise doesn't matter (i.e. Reference flicker is much greater)
	Also, we don't optimize for reference flicker, it will be constant no matter what,
	reference is separate from PLL and PLL reponse is flat N multiplier from ref to output.
